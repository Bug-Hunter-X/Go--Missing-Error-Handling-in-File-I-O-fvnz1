# Go: Missing Error Handling in File I/O

This repository demonstrates a common error in Go programs: neglecting to check for errors after potentially failing operations.  Specifically, this example highlights the lack of error handling when reading from a file.

The `bug.go` file shows the problematic code. The `bugSolution.go` file provides a corrected version with proper error handling.

## Problem

The `bug.go` program attempts to read data from a file. However, it doesn't check for errors that might occur during the file opening or reading processes (e.g., file not found).  If an error happens, the program will silently fail, potentially leading to unexpected results or crashes.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.go` demonstrates how to correctly handle potential errors.  It uses the standard `errors.Is` function to check for specific errors.
